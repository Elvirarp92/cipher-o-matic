# Cipher-O-Matic

Cipher-O-Matic is a single page, MERN based, web application to encrypt text using classic cyphers. It uses a RESTful API to make the encryption calculations, and makes use of Jest for unit testing. Work in progress - see Roadmap to have a gander at the planned features!

| POST       | /caesar   | Encrypts **plaintext** with the Caesar cipher, shifting letters **factor** positions in the alphabet. |

## üß≠ Roadmap

- Modifying the Caesar function so it also can decrypt ciphertext.
- Including endpoints to encrypt/decrypt in Atbash and Vigen√®re ciphers.
