# Cipher-O-Matic

Cipher-O-Matic is a single page, MERN based, web application to encrypt text using classic cyphers. It uses a RESTful API to make the encryption calculations, and makes use of Jest for unit testing. Work in progress - see Roadmap to have a gander at the planned features!

## üîå API endpoints

| **Method** | **Route** | **Description**                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST       | /caesar   | Encrypts or decrypts text (argument **direction**) with the Caesar cipher, shifting letters **factor** positions in the alphabet. |

## üß≠ Roadmap

- ~~Modifying the Caesar function so it also can decrypt ciphertext.~~ Done!
- Including endpoints to encrypt/decrypt in other ciphers:
  - Atbash
  - Vigen√®re
  - Enigma
- Adding checkbox to eliminate all spaces on input text
